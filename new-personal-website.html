    <h1>Silene armeria</h1>


    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    <p>
    <b>Silene armeria</b>, commonly known as the <b>Sweet William catchfly</b>, is a species of <a href="#">plant</a> in the family Caryophyllaceae. Originally a native of Europe, it has become widespread in the United States. Perennial in USDA plant hardiness zones 5 to 8. A small-growing form is known as dwarf catchfly. The name comes from the way in which small insects are trapped by the sticky sap exuded onto the stem. However it is not currently regarded as a carnivorous plant, though it has been identified as a carnivorous plant in the past.[1]
